## 2024 Woodchip Drop Instructions

The Just Food Community Farm at 2391 Pepin Court has many uses for wood chips.  It is a large property, but the deliveries should stick to dropping near the paved parking lot to avoid getting stuck on dirt roads.  
Here is a link to a map which shows that there are a system of grid roads and some preferred drop sites for wood chips: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1D8wyWYOCxyGg0cgJ9OAMD_2W_RXH2P8&usp=sharing 
Thanks kindly!  Preferred location for chip drop is at Drop Site B, with backup location of Chip Drop C as per the map.
